# ShubhSingh_MiniPlatformer
This project is a part of the assessment for applying as a Game Developer at AutoVRse. Please find a full description of the project below.

Objective: 

The goal of this game is to navigate through the levels, collect coins and reach to the end of the level. 
Please note that the game is still under development, so the game design might change. Anyhow, this readme file will be updated accordingly

Packages used:

The Dotween package has been used for the movement of platforms in the game.

Code Structure:

Given the complexity of this project is rather simple, proper patterns and coding practices have been used to maintain the cleanliness of 
the codebase. The design patterns used are singleton(for all manager scripts), and the observer design pattern(to maintain the modularity of
the code) which helps establish the SOLID principles. Some other basic yet important concepts of coding that have been used are getters and setters, 
scriptable objects
inheritance and function overloading.
Individual descriptions of each script has been commented within them.
Please note that the game is still under development, so the code structure might change. Anyhow, this readme file will be updated accordingly.

Controls:

Even though there is a separate tutorial within the game itself, the controls have been attached in this file just to be safe.

A,D- Movement in left and right respectively
Shift - Dash
Spacebar - Jump

Build Status:
The first build has been uploaded within the releases folder. This build is the final build, and it will be updated if there were any minor changes
to be made.
