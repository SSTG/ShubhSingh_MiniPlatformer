# ShubhSingh_MiniPlatformer
This project is a part of the assessment for applying as a Game Developer at AutoVRse. Please find a full description of the project below.

Objective: 

The goal of this game is to navigate through the levels, collect coins and reach to the end of the level. There is a star-based grading system which is
decided based on the number of stars and the time taken to complete level.
Please note that the game is still under development, so the game design might change. Anyhow, this readme file will be updated accordingly

Packages used:

Please note that no external assets have been used for coding. The assets used are solely for aesthetic purposes, and whose links I've shared
below. The list will be updated as new assets are imported into the project



Code Structure:

Given the complexity of this project is rather simple, proper patterns and coding practices have been used to maintain the cleanliness of 
the codebase. The design patterns used are singleton(for GameManager and SceneManager), and the observer design pattern(to maintain the modularity of
the code) which helps establish the SOLID principles. Some other basic yet important concepts of coding that have been used are getters and setters,
inheritance,
and function overloading.
Individual descriptions of each script has been commented within them.
Please note that the game is still under development, so the code structure might change. Anyhow, this readme file will be updated accordingly.

Controls:

Even though there is a separate tutorial within the game itself, the controls have been attached in this file just to be safe.

A,D- Movement in left and right respectively
Shift - Dash
Spacebar - Jump
